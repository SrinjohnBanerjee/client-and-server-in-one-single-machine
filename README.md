# client-and-server-in-one-single-machine

this is a project i tried doing by refering to yt tutorial 
i learned about the workflow of both client and server
we atfirst call the socket() --> then connect() --> then recv()  this is the workflow of the client
Then for the server we use the socket() --> bind() --> listen() -- accept() --> send()
